# Supermarket Database - S-Market Online 1.0

This is Supermarket management tool built with its front-end based on the Swing API in JAVA and the backend as required has been constructed on 
MySQL command line client. It allows 3 different types of users depending on their position in the supermarket, that is

1. Admin - With the rights to manage employees, product data/catalog and the data on current and old orders

2. Employee - With the rights to review specific product data that they are associated with handling and its respective properties
such as pricing, available quantity and so on

3. Customer - The customer's data is independent of the others and thus the customer can register independently, while the employee is
strictly managed by the admin. The customer can also view the entire product catalog and can choose what to buy and can finally checkout
with any changes as per necessity.

The compiled .jar file is also uploaded in the folder "dist" in the repository, which can be downloaded and used on any JAVA 
enabled system.

The SQL data dump is also provided to create the database on mysql as per requirement locally and run it accordingly.
